Decision tree and random forest:
Some say it's machine learning and some say it's rule based modelling
Decision tree works on greedy algorithm
Continous variables we will be discretizing to discrete data
How we discrete data that is continous: We will plot a histogram and then take non uniform bin data into categories.
If the data is granular, the classification model is better.
The nodes which doesn't need further split are called leaf nodes.
Decision tree is a classification algorithm
No of leafs = no of rules
Entropy - is a measure of disorder or randomness
More unpredictable = More randomness = More entropy
Information gain shoud be high.
And that corresponding col which has higher info gain will be choosen first.
The whole objective of doing this classification is to have less rules. For this to be done, we need to choose the column that we start the split wisely and the measure for choosing is info gain. Info gain is nothing but entropy of output col - entropy of selected col. If this measure is high, then we should start split with this column.
